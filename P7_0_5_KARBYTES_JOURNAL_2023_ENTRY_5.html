<p>In the last <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a>, I said that I would try to &#8220;live more in the present moment&#8221; (I suppose as opposed to thinking about possible futures and reminiscing about the past and maybe even dreaming into or fantasizing about parallel universes which are concurrent with the present moment &#8220;window&#8221; I happen to be interfacing with reality through through what appears to be exactly one human nervous system which has been alive for approximately 33 years). Please dismiss what I said in that journal entry and what I said in the journal entry prior to that one. I was not exactly feeling my best and I was distracted by &#8220;low brow&#8221; problems which have been plaguing me for many months instead of being able to tap into a sense of magic, inspiration, optimism, and freedom which really first came into fruition for me as a teenager. What allowed me to rekindle those long lost zest for life and sense of freedom, creativity, and euphoria was driving down Bollinger Canyon Road from Dublin to San Ramon instead of driving either one of my parents&#8217; houses in Castro Valley (and I almost drove to Castro Valley until I saw how slow and congested the 580 freeway traffic was in both directions). I am happy to have followed my intuition which told me to go exploring a region of Dublin and San Ramon which I do not remember ever traversing. What I saw was many very nice looking hiking and bicycling trails connecting extending into beautiful and spacious patches of wilderness next to smooth rolling hills and many canyons near upscale neighborhoods. I hope to wake up early in the morning before sunrise to go perusing those trails and to enjoy the beautiful morning sunlight illuminating those canyons while walking along the trails.</p>
<p>Anyway, <span style="background: #ffff00">I do not intend to limit my words, thoughts, sensory experiences, and actions to what I wrote in prior web pages. I would rather just let this journal entry represent a &#8220;start over new&#8221; point in my journey where I make no promises about how I intend to spend my time in the future so that I have as much freedom as possible and so that I do not cut myself off of worthwhile opportunities which I would otherwise miss out on if I were too regimented and inflexible about what I allow myself to do with my time and energy.</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>By the way, I was able to get a doctor&#8217;s approval to increase my testosterone cypianate injection dosages from 0.5 milliliters to 0.7 milliliters (and I administer a shot of testosterone cypianate to my thigh muscles with a syringe and needle once ever two weeks). I am tentatively attempting to increase the dosage gradually to at least 1 milliliters because I read that is a typical dosage amount for female-to-male transexuals. My next in-office doctor&#8217;s appointment to check my hemoglobin and hormone levels is not for another three months. The doctor said that, after being on the testosterone for one year, the in-person checkups need to only happen once per year. (I initially started testosterone cypianate injections in 2009 and stopped midway through 2010 with Dimensions Clinic in San Francisco; a clinic for queer young adults. Right now I am getting &#8220;gender affirming care&#8221; through Planned Parenthood at the clinic on Bush Street in San Francisco (and the process of going to that clinic has been relatively quick, easy, and a lot less bureaucratic than my experience at the first clinic. I seem to be trusted more to manage my own well-being and I seem to be given more authority over my own health care and such. I do support Planned Parenthood as an organization because it affirms woman&#8217;s rights to access abortion and such and makes healthcare accessible to people regardless of their income levels)).</p>
<p>Related to what I just said in the previous paragraph is a thought I have been having recently: that basic healthcare (including &#8220;gender affirming hormone therapy&#8221;) should essentially be free and covered by the state (and for me it basically is). I also think that should be the case for food (up to a certain amount), transportation costs (up to a certain amount), and miscellaneous spending (up to a certain amount) (and I say &#8220;up to a certain amount&#8221; not to make people poor but rather to ensure that there is enough universal basic income money to cover every person&#8217;s basic expenses). Meanwhile, <span style="background: #00ff00">I condone as many jobs as possible (especially boring and dangerous jobs) being outsourced to robots while humans are able to pursue employment opportunities optionally and not as a mandatory means to get money to pay for basic necessities. I envision a future where all humans will be free to spend almost 100% of their time as they choose to (and I believe that many if not most humans will want to do some kind of part time job which pays them extra money in exchange for doing work such as quality assurance, customer service, nursing, teaching, arts, scientific research, and engineering because such work gives people a sense of meaningful community, ongoing learning opportunities, the chance to utilize talents and interests, and the opportunity to earn income in addition to receiving an unconditional universal basic income on a regular periodic basis). Based on what I have been reading about in the news and in books, I think that such a radical upgrade to society across the globe will happen within the next 20 years.</span></p>

<p>In addition to screenshots showing the updated prescription for testosterone cypianate, I also decided to include some screenshots from my recent web browsing of memes which I thought were particularly inspiring and relevant to my priorities.</p>
