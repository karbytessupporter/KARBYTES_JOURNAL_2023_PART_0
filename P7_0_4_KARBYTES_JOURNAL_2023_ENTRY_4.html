<p>I have apparently moved on from <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday&#8217;s journal</a> and no longer feel that I am being forced to do nothing with my life. Today I added more items to the list of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free online study resources</a> (and my favorite items which I added are calculators which solve derivatives and integrals and which show steps involved and graphing (created by a guy named David Scherfgen)). One more thing: I am going to try living in the present moment more and not announce every detail about my life. There are things occurring in my life which I am not disclosing in these journals. Erring on the side of saying &#8220;too little&#8221; rather than &#8220;too much&#8221; seems to save me time, prevent me from feeling overwhelmed by having to explain the details of details (including followup details pertaining to things like doctor appointments, job interviews, business transactions, and social life). Limiting what I voluntarily share online to just a few topics and contexts gives me a sense of having more control and more privacy than I used to when I shared so much information online that it felt stifling to manage my reputation and database.</p>
<p>Note: I updated my GitHub profile location data from &#8220;San Francisco Bay Area&#8221; to &#8220;San Francisco Bay Area, California, United States&#8221;.</p>
