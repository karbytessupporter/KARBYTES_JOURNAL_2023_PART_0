<p>Karbytes&#8217; Goals to Complete Within the Next Three Months:</p>
<p>1. Look for free or relatively low-cost online resources for studying calculus and physics (especially introductory quantum mechanics). Look for homework problem solving web applications and online calculators to check my work.</p>
<p>2. Practice solving calculus problems by hand using pen and paper and use the online problem solvers and calculators to check my work to make sure that my answers and problem solving methods are correct.</p>
<p>3. After I feel that I have a sense of mastery over what I am learning, create software applications (which are featured in <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00">code web pages</strong>) which demonstrate what I have learned and which function as study aids and maybe even write <strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000">prose web pages</strong> about some of the metaphysical and physical phenomena I have been reading about, watching videos about, and maybe even doing physical experiments about in Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com.</p>
